Algorithm to determine if a one-to-one char mapping between two strings is possible
Question:

Determine whether a one-to-one character mapping exists from one string, s1, to another string,
s2.

For example, given s1 = abc and s2 = bcd , print " true" into stdout since we can map each
character in "abc" to a character in "bcd".

Given s1 = foo and s2 = bar , print " false" since the character ‘o’ cannot map to two characters.

Given s1 = foo and s2 = brr , print " false" since the character ‘o’ cannot map to two characters.

But given s1 = bar and s2 = foo , print "true " since each character in "bar" can be mapped to a
character in "foo".
